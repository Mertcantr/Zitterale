# Zitterale
Zitterale is a client-hook for Counter-Strike 1.6 which hooks required functions through data pointer and stack manipulation. It is also immune against screenshot taking tools (e.g. anti-cheats) which use glReadPixels to take screenshots.

You will need BeaEngine (http://www.beaengine.org/) and HLSDK to compile.
